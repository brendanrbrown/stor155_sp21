### data: `affairs_samp`
We will work again with survey data on marital infidelity from a Psychology study from the 1960s. 

This time, I have randomly generated two samples of equally small size, identified by the `sampid` variable.

Get this data

#### more info
Each observation represents one respondent's answers.

**See here for more information** on this dataset (same as last time)
https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/doc/AER/Affairs.html

### goal: let's do some p-hacking

We're going to do some minor p-hacking to explore a bit more why it's bad. See the links in the `hypotest_three` slides for more detailed analyses of ways p-hacking has been abused.

p-hacking is a problem in particular when datasets are small.

### code used to generate samples
import pandas as pd
import scipy.stats as statsd = pd.read_csv('https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/AER/Affairs.csv')d.head()d.loc[:, 'young'] = d.loc[:, 'age'].le(32)
d.loc[:, 'some_affairs'] = d.loc[:, 'affairs'].ge(1)dsamp = [d.groupby(['young', 'gender', 'children']).sample(n = 8, replace = True).assign(sampid = i) for i in range(2)]d = pd.concat(dsamp, axis = 0).drop(columns = 'Unnamed: 0')
d.to_csv('../data/affairs_samp.csv', index = False)
d.to_excel('../data/affairs_samp.xlsx', index = False)
# Q1
Load the data as usual. **For `sampid = 0` (see data explanation)**

- **create a pivot table** (or grouped summary information in pandas, same as last time) with 
    - group variables `young` and `children`
    - summary statistics for `some_affairs`: `mhat` (sample mean), `shat` (sample s.d.), `n` number of samples per group, `sehat` (s.d. of the mean using CLT, aka standard error)

- **create another pivot table** (or grouped summary information in pandas, same as last time) with 
    - group variables `young` and `gender`
    - same summary stats for `some_affairs`
    
**Note for excel users**: You don't need to rename the pivot table columns to those listed above.

Pandas users also can call things what they want, so long as the names are clear.

# Q2

Using data from the pivot tables above:

- for **young = FALSE**,
    - **calculate** the p-values for a difference of means test between the no-children and children subgroups
    - **calculate** the p-values for a difference of means test between the female and male gender groups
    
- for **young = TRUE**,
    - **calculate** the p-values for a difference of means test between the no-children and children subgroups
    - **calculate** the p-values for a difference of means test between the female and male gender groups
    
In each case you will do a **two-sided** hypothesis test, meaning the alternative hypothesis is that the true means (proportions) are not equal.

# Q3
Using the p-values from Q2, 

- **state** in which cases you can reject the null at a level `alpha = 0.1`
- **state** which case gives smallest p-value obtained


**A:** You can't reject in any case at this level.

# Q4

**Repeat Q1** but for the sample `sampid = 1`.

# Q5

**Repeat Q2** but for the data created in Q4.

# Q6

**Repeat Q3** but for the p-values from Q4.

# Q7

Compare your answers in Q5, Q3.

- **State** using concepts from class whether or not this provides strong evidence for your conclusions in Qs 3, 5.

- If your conclusions changed: Give one reason (from class concepts) why this might be reasonable.

- If your conclusions did not change: Give one reason (from class concepts) why they might differ.
