### data
We will work with survey data on marital infidelity from a Psychology study from the 1960s. The dataset is provided by the creators of RDatasets, a package for the R statistical programming language.

Each observation represents one respondent's answers.

### research question

Do people who are less than or equal to 34 years old engage in some extramarital sex (any amount) at different rates than those who are older?

# Q1
Look at the data description linked above to answer the questions below.

- **State clearly, with a brief explanation** whether the `age` variable is numeric or categorical. 
- **State clearly, with a brief explanation** whether the `affairs` variable is numeric or categorical.

This is a little tricky. **Do not solely rely on the variable description's determination of numeric/categorical type**, which gives variable type from a programming language perspective. Use the definition of numeric/categorical discussed in class.

# Q2

- **create** a new variable `young` that is 1 (or in python you can use True) if the respondent's age is less than or equal to 34, and 0 (or False) otherwise.
- **create** a pivot table (excel) or grouped data frame summary (python) showing the **number of observations** by groups defined by pairs of `gender` and `young` variables

# Q3
You may do Q3, Q2 together in one table/summary data frame if you choose.

- **create** a new variable `some_affairs` that is 1 (or in python you can use True) if the `affairs` variable is greater than zero, and 0 (or False) otherwise. This records whether or not the respondent claimed an extramarital sex in the past year. 
- **create** a pivot table (excel) or grouped data frame summary (python) showing the **average of** `some_affairs` by groups defined by the `gender` and `young` variables
- **describe briefly** (1 sentence is fine) what the summary table shows

# Q4

- **calculate** `mhat_young` and `mhat_old`, point estimates for the average of `some_affairs` for the groups `young == 1` (or True in python) and `young == 0` respectively.
- **calculate** `shat_young` and `shat_old`, point estimates for the standard deviations of `some_affairs` for the groups `young == 1` (or True in python) and `young == 0` respectively.
- **calculate** `serr_young` and `serr_old`, point estimates for the standard deviations of **of the means** of `some_affairs` for the groups `young == 1` (or True in python) and `young == 0` respectively, for samples of the appropriate sizes for each group.

Python note: You don't need to create separate objects with those given names if you don't want to. The best way to do this is with a `groupby().agg(['f1', 'f2', 'f3'])` where `f1` etc are appropriate function names. This will give a data frame with all of the relevant information. You can then calculate a new column called `serr` using `assign()` or whatever method you prefer.

Hint: For the final calculation you will first need to count the number of observations within each group.

# Q5
Suppose the assumptions needed for a two-sample difference of means test are valid here.

- **Calculate the p-value** for the following hypothesis test using the point estimates from Q4:

$$H_0: m_{\text{young}} = m_{\text{old}}, \quad \quad H_1: m_{\text{young}} \neq m_{\text{old}}$$

# Q6

- **Explain briefly:** Can you reject the null hypothesis with 90 percent confidence? Be specific in your justification and use concepts from class, but the answer need not be more than one sentence.

# Q7
We don't have much information about how this study was performed. Without spending time to research how it was done (you can for your own purposes if you want), answer the following:

- **Write one or two sentences** about what you should ask the study creators to evaluate whether your hypothesis test assumptions are valid. Be specific and use concepts from class.
