# Continuous distributions

---
class: left, top

## So far we've seen **discrete** probability distributions

.pull-left[
### 'discrete' because

$$P(X = x_i) > 0$$ 

for distinct outcomes $x_1 \ldots$

which are often whole numbers
]

.pull-right[
### examples

$$X \text{ is Bernoulli(p)}, \quad x_1 = 1, x_2 = 0$$

$$X \text{ is Binomial(N, p)},$$
$$\quad x_1 = 0, \,  \ldots x_{N+1} = N$$
$$X \text{ is Geometric(p)},$$
$$ \quad x_1 = 1, x_2 = 2, \, \ldots$$
]

### Imagine this on a bar chart, with height as probability

$$P(X = k) ={5 \choose k}p^k(1-p)^{5-k}, \quad k = 0\ldots 5$$

## Continuous random variables

.pull-left[
### key facts

#### takes a *range* of possible values


$$\text{e.g., } \quad 0 \le X \le 1$$

$$\text{e.g., } \quad -\infty < X < \infty$$

#### no gaps between values

$$P(X = x) = 0$$

for any particular value $x$
]
.pull-right[
#### instead have a **probability density** function $p(x)$ 

$$\frac{P(x \le X \le x + \Delta x)}{\Delta x} \approx p(x)$$

for a small value $\Delta x$.

$$P(X \le x)$$
$$= \text{area under the curve p(y) for } y \le x$$

$$P(a \le X \le b) = \int_a^b p(x) dx$$
if you remember calculus from high school.

# Uniform distribution
## mother of all

---
class: left, top

## Uniform(0, 1) distribution

$p(x) = 1 \quad \text{for } 0 \le x \le 1$ and $0$ for all other $x$.

## Expectation, variance

$$E(X) = 1/2$$

$$Var(X) = 1/12$$

### for those who have taken calculus

$$E(X) = \int_0^1 x dx, \quad Var(X) = \int_0^1 x^2 dx - \left(\int_0^1 x dx \right)^2 $$

## Exact density vs. histogram

#### Q: Why does it make sense that $E(X) = 1/2$?

## Uniform(a, b) for $a < b$

Density is a horizontal line between $a$ and $b$.

$p(x) = \frac{1}{b-a} \quad \text{for } a \le x \le b$ and $0$ for all other $x$.

## Expectation, variance

$$E(X) = (a+b)/2 = \text{ midpoint between a, b}$$

$$Var(X) = (b-a)^2/12$$

## Definition: Cumulative distribution function (CDF)

$$F_X(x) = P(X \le x) = \text{CDF of X at }x$$

.pull-left[
### Discrete distributions

$$F_X(x_K) = \sum_{i = 1}^K P(X = x_i)$$

sum of probabilities for possible outcomes $x_1 \le x_2 \ldots \le x_K$ where $x_K$ is one of the possible outcomes of $X$.

To calculate $F_X(x)$ for $x$ **between** possible values, use the next possible value below $x$.

### Continuous distributions

#### Area under the curve given by density function $p(\cdot)$ to the left of $x$
]

---
class: left, top
### CDF of Uniform(0, 1)
$$F_X(x) = P(X \le x) = x$$

since this is the area of the rectangle of height 1, width $x$.

### CDF of Uniform(a, b)

$$F_X(x) = \frac{x-a}{b-a} $$

### CDF of Binomial(10, 1/2)

$$F_X(4) = \sum_{i = 1}^4 {10 \choose i}p^i(1-p)^{10-i}$$


#### Use a computer!
Calculating CDFs by hand is either tedious or not really possible

---
class: left, top

## Definition: Inverse CDF, aka quantile function

$$F_X^{-1}(u) = \text{uth theoretical quantile of distribution for X}$$

### Remember
When looking at data, the $u$th quantile is the 

- value of a variable 
- so that $u$ proportion of observations 
- are less than or equal to that value.

**Same idea here**

## Sample from any distribution!

$X$ is some random variable with CDF $F_X$.

$$U \sim \text{Uniform}(0, 1)$$

then

$$F_X^{-1}(U) \text{ has the same distribution as } X$$

### how to use this

Sample independent Uniform(0, 1) random variables $U_1 \ldots U_N$, then 

$$F_X^{-1}(U_1), \ldots  F_X^{-1}(U_N) \text{ gives N independent samples of } X$$

#### **This is the best (only?) way to sample random variables in Excel**

# Normal distribution

---
class: left, top

## Normal(0, 1) distribution
The famous **bell curve**

$$E(X) = 0, \quad \quad \sqrt{Var(X)} = SD(X) = 1, \quad \quad -\infty < X < \infty$$

![](https://github.com/brendanrbrown/stor155_sp21/raw/main/notebooks/images/normal.jpeg)

---
class: left, top

## Normal(m, s)
The **mean shifts the middle of the bell** and the **standard deviation determines how wide the bell is**.
$$E(X) = m, \quad \quad \quad SD(X) = s, \quad \quad -\infty < X < \infty$$

class: left, top

## Convert Normal(m, s) to Normal(0, 1)

If $X$ is Normal(m, s) then 

$$Z = \frac{X-m}{s} \text{ is Normal(0, 1)}$$

### This is called a 'z-score'

#### these will come back later in hypothesis testing

#### often used in statistics classes to calculate CDFs of Normal(m, s)

#### using a 'z-table'

But we won't do that in this class because ... mumble mumble ... computers exist
