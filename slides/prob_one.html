class: left, top

## Instructions posted at [course github page](github.com/brendanrbrown/stor155_sp21/project)

## **READ THESE CAREFULLY**

## Key difference from homework

### Under no circumstances should you communicate with other students about your work for this project

### *absolutely none*, and this work is covered by honor code policies as if it were a test

#### but you are free to use various online resource pages that we've been using for homework

## What you will learn

- definitions: random variable, probability, expectation
- calculating expectation
- first steps to calculating probabilities of discrete random variables

## Resources

- Textbook: ch 3.1

# Recap and motivation

---
class: left, top

## We've learned ways to investigate **sample datasets.**

## **sample data** comes from a larger population, roughly speaking

## **it matters** how the sample is collected!

## and to understand this we need a little bit of probability

---
class: left, top

## Uses of probability and sampling extend far beyond than sample data collection

## with these tools, you will have a better understanding of how to answer questions like

.pull-left[
- how do I understand **margins of error** in economic forecasts?

- if that basketball player is on a **hot streak**, what's the chance she makes her next two shots?

- how long would it take someone randomly entering characters to guess my password?

]
.pull-right[
- if I **test positive** for covid/HIV/breast cancer/... **what's the chance I actually have it?**

- if I test negative, what's the chance I don't?

- what's up with the **bell curve**, and why is it everywhere?

# This will be the toughest section of the class for most of you. 

# **You have to work hard if you want to do well.**

# I am here to help you --- but you must be willing to put in the work.

## Everything in the world is the result of some **process**
.pull-left[

- metabolism converts food to energy in living organisms

- weather today driven by atmospheric forces

- my salary, determined by my employment contract

]
.pull-right[
- size of your heart at age 51, in ounces

- whether or not you win the lottery *this* time

- amount of caffeine in a cup of coffee, in grams, as measured in an experiment

# Definition

&gt;&gt; ## An outcome subject to randomness is one such that the **same process doesn't always lead to the same outcome.**

Otherwise a process is called deterministic.

---
class: left, top

## It's a philosophical question as to whether *anything* is truly random.

## In this course, we will focus on things that can be  **best understood as random**

## to which the **tools of probability can be applied**


---
class: left, top

## will build understanding by looking at **examples** as in data labs

## e.g., which of these pictures was generated at random?

## Definition

### a **random variable** is the outcome of a random process

.pull-left[
### **discrete** random variable

#### takes **integer** values

#### or **categorical**, like the categorical data seen previously

]

.pull-right[
### **continuous** random variable

#### takes numeric values

#### in a range of possible values, finite or infinite
]

### to **sample** a random variable means to **observe** one or more outcomes from this same random process

---

# Probability

---
class: left, top

### Probabilities associated with processes and their outcomes are

#### **Statistical** point of view

&gt;&gt; 'The probability of an outcome is the proportion of times the outcome would occur if we observed the random process an infinite number of times.'

&gt;&gt; textbook ch 3.1.1

#### **Mathematical** point of view

- numbers **between 0 and 1**
- one **for each possible outcome** (maybe an infinite number)
- representing the **weights used to calculate theoretical, weighted average** outcome
- and weights of all possible outcomes **must add to one**
- meaning *something* will happen for sure, though we don't yet know what.


---
class: left, top

## Weighted averages and expectations

&gt;&gt; the **expectation** of a random variable (r.v.) `\(X\)` is a **weighted average of all possible outcomes**, with weights given by the probabilities

`$$P(X = x) \quad \text{is} \quad \text{the probability r.v. X takes outcome } x$$`

#### For a **discrete** r.v. `\(X\)` with `\(n\)` possible outcomes `\(x_1 ... x_n\)`, the **expectation of `\(X\)`** is defined mathematically as

$$E(X) = \sum_1^n x_i \, P(X = x_i) \,   = x_1\,P(X = x_1) + ... x_n\,P(X = x_n) $$
---
class: left, top

## Example

In this example, the r.v. will represent the outcome from a coin toss. Each of the two outcomes is **equally likely.**


`$$X = 1 \quad \text{if coin comes up heads},  \quad \quad X = 0 \quad \text{if tails}$$`



### Using the rules of probability and expectation, tell me

#### `\(P(X = 1) =\)` ?

#### `\(E(X) =\)` ?

## Rules of expectation

for any two random variables `\(X, Y\)`

.pull-left[
#### `\(E(X + Y) = E(X) + E(Y)\)`

#### `\(E(aX) = aE(X)\)` for any number `\(a\)`
]
.pull-right[

#### `\(E(X) \ge \text{minimum}(x_1, x_2, ... x_n)\)`

#### `\(E(X) \le \text{maximum}(x_1, x_2, ... x_n)\)`

]

### example:

I flip a coin. If heads, I pay you 5 dollars. Otherwise you get nothing. `\(X\)` is the amount you win from this game.

#### possible outcomes?

#### `\(P(X = 0) =\)` ?

#### `\(E(X) =\)` ?

### Basic application of probability rules (and your intuition) tell you the answer

### but you could have investigated this with a simulation!

class: left, top

### General method for calculating probabilities when all outcomes are equally likely

`$$P(X = x_i) = \frac{\text{number of ways } x_i \text{ can happen}}{\text{number of outcomes}}$$`

### example: pick one random card from a [briscola deck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Briscola)

there are **40 cards** and **four suits** with an equal number of cards: clubs, coins, cups and swords.

`$$X = 1 \quad \text{if card is cups},  \quad \quad X = 0 \quad \text{if not}$$`
