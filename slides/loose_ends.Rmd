## What you will learn

- t-tests
- why t-tests aren't worth much for this course

## Resources

# Small-sample hypothesis tests

### So the Central Limit Theorem is pretty good

### but what if your **sample is too small** for the CLT to hold?


.pull-left[
#### Some rules of thumb from textbook

**For n random samples from Bernoulli(p)**

$$np \ge 10, \quad \text{and} \quad n(1-p) \ge 10$$

meaning you see enough successes and enough failures. Textbook ch 7.1.1.

.pull-right[
#### but rules of thumb are &#128169;

**better to evaluate CLT assumptions** (might be hard)

**better still to get more random samples** (often less hard)

### Easy fix: Swap normal distribution for t-distribution
For example in a **difference of means test**
$$p = 2 P\left(T_d < -\frac{|\hat{m}_{n_1} - \hat{m}_{n_0}|}{\hat{s}_{n_1, n_0}}\right)$$
where $T_d$ is a t-distributed random variable with $d$ 'degrees of freedom'. $d = n_1 + n_2 - 2$ in the two-sample difference of means test.

A **similar formula holds for the one-sample test**, replacing the standard normal $Z$ with $T_d$ where $d = n-1$.

### with a computer

#### Excel: `T.DIST`

#### Python: `scipy.stats.t`

and there are even baked-in functions for doing t-tests or z-tests. But **make sure you use them correctly** as there are several versions with various options.

### but really, this isn't worth much talk

the t-distribution is almost identical to the normal for any reasonable sample size

```{r, dpi=300, out.height=500, out.width=800}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)

x <- seq(-4, 4, by = .1)
df <- seq(2, 32, by = 5)

d <- lapply(df, FUN = function(s) dt(x, s))
nm <- paste("df", df, sep = "_")
# for sorting and plotting in correct color order
nm[c(1, 2)] <- c("df_02", "df_07")
names(d) <- nm

d <- bind_cols(d) %>% mutate(x = x, z = dnorm(x)) %>%
  tidyr::pivot_longer(cols = !x, names_to = "distribution") %>%
  arrange(distribution)

ggplot(d, aes(x, value, color = distribution)) + geom_line(lwd = 1.5) +
  scale_color_brewer(palette = "Oranges")
```

### You should just **get more data** rather than worry about the t distribution

.pull-left[
### worry more about

#### independence assumption of sampling

#### more complex requirements for more complex hypothesis test methods

#### which can be **hard in practice to evaluate**
]
.pull-right[
### in rare cases, small sample sizes are unavoidable

#### rare events

#### more generally: when data collection is very very expensive
