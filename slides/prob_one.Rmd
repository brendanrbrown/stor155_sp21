## Instructions posted at [course github page](github.com/brendanrbrown/stor155_sp21/project)

## **READ THESE CAREFULLY**

## Key difference from homework

### Under no circumstances should you communicate with other students about your work for this project

### *absolutely none*, and this work is covered by honor code policies as if it were a test

#### but you are free to use various online resource pages that we've been using for homework

---
class: left, top

# To help you


### Data lab this week instead will be an **extended office hours.**

### **Keep the excel/python split** for the usual data lab time period to avoid chaos

### A webassign homework but no additional data homework

---
class: left, top

# Tips

### up to homework 3 is now graded

### first thing to do is review your homework **and the posted solutions**

### **get started early**

### remember: You won't get answers to last-minute questions

---
class: left, top

## Specific tip on written answers

### Many people lost points for nonsensical, circular logic in written responses. Writing more of a weak answer doesn't make it better.

>> "it makes sense the correlation is close to 1 because the plot shows a strong correlation""

### A better answer is (credit: Sejal Rai)

>> "The correlation in Q5 makes sense because the r value of .96 is very close to 1, meaning that the correlation between China and the US is both strong and positive. This is shown visually in the Q2 graph, since the points make a positive and almost perfectly straight line ..."

## What you will learn

- definitions: random variable, probability, expectation
- calculating expectation
- first steps to calculating probabilities of discrete random variables

- Textbook: ch 3.1

# Recap and motivation

---
class: left, top

## We've learned ways to investigate **sample datasets.**

## **sample data** comes from a larger population, roughly speaking

## **it matters** how the sample is collected!

## and to understand this we need a little bit of probability

---
class: left, top

## Uses of probability and sampling extend far beyond than sample data collection

## with these tools, you will have a better understanding of how to answer questions like

.pull-left[
- how do I understand **margins of error** in economic forecasts?

- if that basketball player is on a **hot streak**, what's the chance she makes her next two shots?

- how long would it take someone randomly entering characters to guess my password?

]
.pull-right[
- if I **test positive** for covid/HIV/breast cancer/... **what's the chance I actually have it?**

- if I test negative, what's the chance I don't?

- what's up with the **bell curve**, and why is it everywhere?

# Definition

>> ## An outcome subject to randomness is one such that the **same process doesn't always lead to the same outcome.**

Otherwise a process is called deterministic.

---
class: left, top

## It's a philosophical question as to whether *anything* is truly random.

## In this course, we will focus on things that can be  **best understood as random**

## to which the **tools of probability can be applied**


---
class: left, top

## will build understanding by looking at **examples** as in data labs

## e.g., which of these pictures was generated at random?

## Definition

### a **random variable** is the outcome of a random process

.pull-left[
### **discrete** random variable

#### takes **integer** values

#### or **categorical**, like the categorical data seen previously

]

.pull-right[
### **continuous** random variable

#### takes numeric values

#### in a range of possible values, finite or infinite
]

### to **sample** a random variable means to **observe** one or more outcomes from this same random process

---
class: inverse, center, middle

# Probability

---
class: left, top

### Probabilities associated with processes and their outcomes are

#### **Statistical** point of view

>> 'The probability of an outcome is the proportion of times the outcome would occur if we observed the random process an infinite number of times.'

>> textbook ch 3.1.1

#### **Mathematical** point of view

- numbers **between 0 and 1**
- one **for each possible outcome** (maybe an infinite number)
- representing the **weights used to calculate theoretical, weighted average** outcome
- and weights of all possible outcomes **must add to one**
- meaning *something* will happen for sure, though we don't yet know what.


---
class: left, top

## Weighted averages and expectations

>> the **expectation** of a random variable (r.v.) $X$ is a **weighted average of all possible outcomes**, with weights given by the probabilities

$$P(X = x) \quad \text{is} \quad \text{the probability r.v. X takes outcome } x$$

#### For a **discrete** r.v. $X$ with $n$ possible outcomes $x_1 ... x_n$, the **expectation of $X$** is defined mathematically as

$$E(X) = \sum_1^n x_i \, P(X = x_i) \,   = x_1\,P(X = x_1) + ... x_n\,P(X = x_n) $$
---
class: left, top

## Example

In this example, the r.v. will represent the outcome from a coin toss. Each of the two outcomes is **equally likely.**


$$X = 1 \quad \text{if coin comes up heads},  \quad \quad X = 0 \quad \text{if tails}$$



### Using the rules of probability and expectation, tell me

#### $P(X = 1) =$ ?

#### $E(X) =$ ?

---
class: left, top

## Rules of expectation

for any two random variables $X, Y$

.pull-left[
#### $E(X + Y) = E(X) + E(Y)$

#### $E(aX) = aE(X)$ for any number $a$
]
.pull-right[

#### $E(X) \ge \text{minimum}(x_1, x_2, ... x_n)$

#### $E(X) \le \text{maximum}(x_1, x_2, ... x_n)$

]

### example:

I flip a coin. If heads, I pay you 5 dollars. Otherwise you get nothing. $X$ is the amount you win from this game.

#### possible outcomes?

#### $P(X = 0) =$ ?

#### $E(X) =$ ?

### Basic application of probability rules (and your intuition) tell you the answer

### but you could have investigated this with a simulation!

---
class: center, middle

```{r, dpi = 250, fig.width=10, fig.height=8}
library(ggplot2)
n <- 100
d <- data.frame(x = 10*sample(0:1, n, replace = T))

ggplot(d, aes(x = x, y = ..prop..)) + geom_bar(fill = '#348899') + theme_minimal() +
  ggtitle("Proportion of outcomes for 100 samples of X")
```

---
class: left, top

### General method for calculating probabilities when all choices are equally likely

$$P(X = x_i) = \frac{\text{number of ways outcome } x_i \text{ can happen}}{\text{number of choices}}$$

### example: pick one random card from a [briscola deck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Briscola)

there are **40 cards** and **four suits** with an equal number of cards: clubs, coins, cups and swords.

$$X = 1 \quad \text{if card is cups},  \quad \quad X = 0 \quad \text{if not}$$

#### to answer, use the formula above, for which you should ask

- how many cards are cups? this is the number of ways $X = 1$ outcome can happen
- how many cards total?

#### to the polls!
