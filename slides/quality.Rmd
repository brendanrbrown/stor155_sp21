- correlation, causality and 'confounding/lurking' variables
- working with surveys
- summarizing subcategories

## Resources

- Textbook ch 1.3-1.5, 1.10 again for categorical variable concepts

# Data collection, and quality of statistical statements

## Review: Big picture

### Our perspective: using data to learn about some aspect of the world

### Often trying to answer a specific question

### Examples from class so far:

.pull-left[
#### distribution of likes for fake news facebook posts?

#### highly liked fake news posts common or rare?

]
.pull-right[
#### land-grant universities still profiting from Morrill Act?

#### trends in female life expectancy? 
]

## Review: Some terms

### *population*: group of people/places/things you hope to learn about

#### national economies, elderly U.S. residents, north atlantic right whales, cat pictures online ...

### *sample*: subset for which you have data. 

#### sometimes sample = population!

### *observation*: unit of a single element in sample data

---
class: left, top

### These distinctions aren't always as clear and neat as the textbook would like you to think.

### Examples from class so far:

.pull-left[
#### **Question:** distribution of likes for fake news facebook posts?

#### **Population:** fake news posts on facebook

#### **Sample:** dataset of posts Buzzfeed identified as fake news in 2018

]
.pull-right[
#### **Question:** trends in women's health / wellbeing in selected countries?

#### **Population:** selected countries

#### **Sample:** female life expectancy at birth from 1960-2018 in those countries

]

## Goal is to evaluate:

### a. **How well do the sample observations represent the population?**

### b. **Does the sample data support my conclusions, or is there something else to explain what I see?**

### c. **Are there problems with my data, such as missing values, that prevent me from adequately answering the question?**

---
class: left, top

## Focus on three types of problems:

### 1. **bad sample**

### 2. **missing or problematic values**

### 3. **confouding/lurking variables**

## Example: The story of a statistic

>> We hear Democrats talking about the middle class and workers ... [but] if only 39 percent of this country can afford a thousand-dollar emergency, we must use the word poverty.

>> ------ Rev. William Barber II [on NPR, Jan. 31 2021](https://www.npr.org/2021/01/31/962638253/civil-rights-activist-weighs-in-on-bidens-early-days-in-office)


### Is this true?

### or at least as close to truth you can get in a soundbite?

### What is it based on?

---
class: left, top

## First step: What's the reference?

### closest I found to what Barber could be talking about was 

>> A similar statistic came out of the 2018 Federal Reserve Report on the Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households, finding that **40% of adults in this country could not afford a $400 emergency**

>> ----- [Numbers behind the Moral Budget](https://www.breachrepairers.org/blogs/explaining-the-140-million), Repairers of the Breach blog post (a Barber-affiliated advocacy group)

### citation:  

#### 2018 Federal Reserve Report on the [Economic Well-Being of U.S. Households](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/report-economic-well-being-us-households.htm)

## Step two: Get the data the stat is based on

.pull-left[
### About the data

#### report based on the Fed's [Survey of Household Economics and Decisionmaking (SHED)](https://www.federalreserve.gov/consumerscommunities/shed.htm)

#### it's a [long questionnaire](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2020-supplemental-appendixes-report-economic-well-being-us-households-2019-overview.htm) asking about households' feelings about the economy, work, financial stability
]
.pull-right[
### What I got

#### 2019 vintage of the survey

#### the most recent year with complete results

## What is the population? (you answer this)


## What is the sample?

#### Good surveys will have a **detailed description of how the sample of respondents (whose responses make up the dataset) was collected**

#### In this case, the sample of about **12,000 respondents** is 'designed to be **representative** of adults age 18 and older living in the United States.'

#### to understand the details, we need to defer to the next section when we discuss randomness.

#### The Fed gives [details here.](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2020-economic-well-being-of-us-households-in-2019-description-of-the-survey.htm)

## How you get your sample matters

### **\[one obs. ... ...  ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... whole pop.\]**

.pull-left[

.pull-right[

### **this isn't very helpful though**

## Rules of thumb for sample data

.pull-left[
## **GOOD**

#### controlled experiment --- e.g. data from measurements in a lab

#### 'random' --- e.g. observations determined by rolling a (many-sided) die

#### details on what randomness means next section

]

.pull-right[
## **BAD**

#### 'anecdotal' sample

#### e.g. ask my friends about fake news they've seen on facebook

#### 'biased' sample where observations are chosen (or self-select) because of certain characteristics

#### e.g. *all online review systems* such as yelp, RMP, Amazon reviews...

#### good if the reviewer shares your values, bad for calculating statistics like averages

## SHED survey: What are the variables?


### Full list in the [codebook](https://www.federalreserve.gov/consumerscommunities/files/SHED-2019-codebook.pdf)

### Class dataset picks out only a few. See the related [notebook on github](https://github.com/brendanrbrown/stor155_sp21/blob/main/notebooks/shed_survey.ipynb)

### Today, interested in responses to 

>> Suppose that you have an emergency expenses that costs $400. Based on your current financial situation, how would you pay for this expense?

### 'afford' to pay it if using cash or card paid off next month

### From the plot, it looks like almot 90 percent *can* afford to pay

### **but**

### Data quality wrinkle: Some people give multiple answers for how they would pay.

### What should we do?

## Takeaways

### about **30 percent** could not 'afford' a $400 emergency in 2019

### **but** when the Fed included data from April 2020, the number [rose to 37 percent](https://www.federalreserve.gov/publications/2020-economic-well-being-of-us-households-in-2019-dealing-with-unexpected-expenses.htm)

### in my *opinion*, **data do support** Barber's basic point

### that about a third of Americans would need to go into debt for even a small financial emergency

#### and this is consistent with the Fed's own interpretation of this data

---
class: center, top

### Why not just remove observations that list more than one way to pay?

### this sub-sample of respondents **differs from the original sample** in a meaningful way 

#### people rating themselves as worse off make up larger proportions of people paying multiple ways

## These ideas are most relevant for 

#### **surveys** (e.g. Census), 

#### **scientific observation** (sample collected in the field) 

#### and **medical studies**

## Doesn't make too much sense for talking about the life expectancy data, for example

## But **it always is relevant to think about how your data were generated!**

# Confounding variables

class: left, top

### Remember the plot of US and Chinese female life expectancy from last time / homework

### r = Corr(US, China) was almost perfect!

### but the **correlation in year over year changes** in the US and China had correlation near zero!

---
class: center, top

### This happens because **both US and China life expectancies are highly positively correlated with time!**


.pull-left[
### **Confounding variable**

#### Z is counfounding for evaluating the relationship between X and Y

#### if Z is strongly correlated with both X and Y

#### so that correlation between X and Y

#### is really just because of their correlation with Z
]
.pull-right[
### e.g. **time is confounding**

### for China and US life expectancies

### in this case can see this by removing the effect of time with year-to-year changes

class: center, top

## This is why when evaluating relationships between variables with correlation

## it's important to talk about positive/negative **relationships**

## and not about one variable *causing* another to increase/decrease
