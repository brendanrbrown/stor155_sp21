class: top, left

## Parameters

### numbers that define a random variable's distribution

### examples:


#### Binomial(N, p): N and p are parameters!


#### Normal(m, s): m and s are parameters!




---
class: top, left

## If you know the parameters, you can 

### calculate the **probabilities** of distribution 

### **sample** from it

#### using a computer

### e.g. homework: input m and s to sample from Normal

## Modeling

.pull-left[
### Abstractions of reality

In this class:

- a model is a probability distribution
- along with its parameters
- that describes a random process.
]
.pull-right[
### Example

#### **Numbers of field goals made** 

- for a known N number of shots
- assumed independent
- with success of shot p

#### Q: What kind of distribution to use?
]

### 'True' parameters are unknown! 

### Use data to plug in estimates for them

# Point estimates and the law of large numbers


---
class: top, left

### A point estimate is a statistic we use to guess at an unknown parameter

$$\text{sample mean is a point estimate for the true mean}$$

$$\text{sample s.d. is a point estimate for the true s.d.}$$

### This works because of the **law of large numbers**
which says

>> if $X_1 \ldots X_n$ are independent (random) samples of a random variable X, then

$$\hat{m} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^n X_i \approx E(X)\quad \text{ for large n}$$
and the same for sample standard deviation vs. true trandard deviation

---
class: top, left

## Example: Bernoulli

#### Say I have $n$ samples $X_1 \ldots X_n$ from a Bernoulli(p)

#### but p is unknown


$$\hat{p} = \frac{\text{# successes}}{n} \approx p$$

## Example: Binomial

#### $n$ samples $X_1 \ldots X_n$ from a Binomial(N, p)

$$\hat{m} = \frac{1}{n} \sum_{i = 1}^n X_i \approx Np$$

## Example: Modeling Paris Kea's 2017-18 field goals
Old data on 2017-18 season for UNC basketball player Paris Kea.

### **Model**

$$X = \text{ field goals made in a game with N attempts}$$

$$X \text{ modeled as Binomial(N, p)}$$

### Why does this model make sense for the data, or not?

---
class: left, top

## Point estimates for the model

#### To make life easy: We will say N is known

$$\hat{p} = \frac{\text{# field goals made across all games}}{\text{# field goals attempted across all games}}$$

### Q: Why does this make sense as a point estimate?

.pull-left[
#### Once we have a point estimate **p**

####  we can **predict** the number of field goals Kea will make for any N attempts

]
.pull-right[
#### and you can use **sampling**

#### to estimate **how risky** your predictions are

#### future homework!
]

$$\text{predicted field goals} = N\hat{p}$$

## Modeling procedure

### 1. **Estimate** $\hat{p}$ based on data from the first 25 games (the 'training data')

### 2. **Predict** outcomes for the next 6 games, for which you have data (the 'test data')

### 3. **Evaluate** how good your model is

#### this is a common basic approach to predictive modeling

---
class: top, left

```{r}
d <- read.csv('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brendanrbrown/stor155_sp21/main/data/paris_stats.csv')
p <- sum(d[1:25, 'field_goals_made'])/sum(d[1:25, 'fg_attempts'])

knitr::kable(data.frame(phat = p))
```
$$\text{predicted field goals} = \hat{p} \times \text{fg_attempts}$$

```{r}
dtest <- d[-c(1:25), ]
dtest$fg_made_pred <- dtest$fg_attempts * p

knitr::kable(dtest[, c("game", "field_goals_made", "fg_made_pred")])
```

remember we are pretending we knew what $N$, number of field goal attempts, was for each game.

#### How good is our prediction? Is it better or worse than what we should have expected?

#### A start:  **How close should $\hat{p}$ be to the true p?**

# Central limit theorem

class: left, top

## Central limit theorem

If $X_1 \ldots X_n$ are **independent** (random) samples of a random variable $X$ where

$$E(X) = m, \quad\quad Var(X) = s^2$$

then writing $\hat{m}_n = \frac{1}{n} \sum_1^n X_i$ for the **sample average**

$$\frac{\hat{m}_n - m}{s/\sqrt{n}} \approx \text{Normal(0, 1)} \quad \text{for large enough sample size n}$$
which is the same as saying
$$\hat{m}_n \approx \text{Normal}\left(m, \frac{s}{\sqrt{n}}\right) \quad \text{for large enough sample size n}$$
#### in words
>> the distribution of the sample mean for a sample of size n (written $\hat{m}_n$) is approximately normal, with the **same expected value** as the original $X$ you sampled from and standard deviation of the original $X$ divided by $\sqrt{n}$

## Why is the CLT so amazing?

### 1. At the heart of much of science for the past 300 years
It's why we take averages of measurements.

### 2. Basis for most statistical tests of 'significance' (future lectures)
and therefore of statistical estimation in economics, business, public policy, physical sciences, medical studies ...

### 3. Shows up in magical ways throughout mathematics

---
class: left, top

.pull-left[
### Key assumptions

#### 1. Independent samples
#### 2. $E(X)$ and $Var(X)$ are finite

second assumption is always true in this class

#### it **works for any distribution** under those assumptions 
]
.pull-right[
### But how big does n have to be?

#### exact answer needs math beyond this course

#### rough answer

>> you need **larger n the more skewed** the sample distribtion is

skewed meaning the histogram is lopsided on the left or right

## Example: Using the CLT
A simplified version of the Paris Kea modeling example, to avoid dealing with different numbers of field goal attempts.

### Setup
Think of our estimated field goal percentage now as estimated *number* of field goals made in $N=20$ attempts. 

Assume her field goal stats across 25 games are **independent.**

$$\hat{m}_{25} = 20\times\hat{p}$$
$$\quad \approx 9.64$$

$$\hat{s} = \sqrt{20\times \hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}$$
### Q: Why are these my point estimates for the true parameters $m$ and $s$?

---
class: left, top

### using the CLT
#### We don't know what the true $p$ is. 

#### can use the CLT and LLN to see **how spread out from the true value our estimate should be**

$$\sqrt{25} \times \frac{\hat{m}_{25} - 20p}{\sqrt{20p(1-p)}} \approx 5 \times \frac{\hat{m}_{25} - 20p}{\sqrt{20\hat{p}(1-\hat{p})}}$$
$$\approx \text{Normal}(0, 1)$$

#### will make this precise next class

### Q: Assuming the CLT normal approximation is correct, how would I calculate

$$P\left(\hat{m}_{25} \text{ is within two standard deviations of the true m}\right)$$
