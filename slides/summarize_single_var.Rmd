## What you will learn

- sample distributions
- plots: bar graphs, histograms
- centrality statistics: mean, median
- spread statistics: range, percentiles (aka quantile), variance and standard deviation

## Resources

- Textbook ch 1.6.2-1.6.5 and 1.10

# Looking at data

class: left, top

## Definition: sample distribution
>> The sample distribution of a variable tells us what values it takes and how often it takes these values in our dataset.


#### this is about the values a variable actually has in your data

#### does *not* tell you about all possible values your variable could have if you got more or different data

### frequency statistics

- **frequency** of a category is the **number of observations** in that category
- **relative frequency** is number of **observations in a category / total** number of observations 

.pull-left[
### distributions: categorical 

- given by **relative frequencies** of each category
- think of it as the chance a randomly chosen observation falls in that category
- e.g. relative frequency of 0.1 for category 'A' means 10 percent of observations of type 'A' 
]
.pull-right[
### distributions: quantitative

- given by **relative frequencies in a range** of possible values
- think of as the chance a randomly chosen observation falls in the range
- will evaluate with  **histogram** plots

## Looking at sample distributions: depends on the variable type

#### bar graphs

#### pie charts

## Looking at categorical data

### bar graph

- bar height represents frequency or relative frequency for each category
- the frequency must first be computed

### pie chart

- area of a pie slice represents the relative frequency of a category
- these can be **hard to read** because areas are difficult to estimate by eye
- can be used **only for** counts adding to the total number of observations, or percentages adding to 100

## Example: Fake news on facebook

.pull-left[
### dataset

- data on Facebook popularity of posts by fake news websites in 2018
- identified and collected by Buzzfeed News
- [Biggest fake news hits on Facebook in 2018](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/craigsilverman/facebook-fake-news-hits-2018)
- source: [Buzzfeed github site](https://github.com/BuzzFeedNews/2018-12-fake-news-top-50)
- dataset on our course github page as well
]


.pull-right[
### observations and variables

- each row is represents an article
- `fb_engagement` is essentially number of likes post received
- `category` is a buzzfeed-created categorical variable

### There are too many weird small categories to show nicely, so I picked some I was interested in.

### but what does it look like if we isolate the most common posting categories?

## Histogram: looking at quantitative variable distributions


.pull-left[
- **breaks the range of the values into bins** (intervals) of a given width
- displays frequencies or relative frequencies of the observations that fall into each interval
]
.pull-right[
- choose any convenient number of intervals of equal width
- but choice of width might affect how you interpret the data
]

### Example: `fb_engagement` variable histogram with differing bin sizes

### A good histogram allows you to guess at key properties of a numeric variable:

1. What are the maximum and minimum values?
2. What is the 'middle' value? 
3. What is the average value?
4. Are the values concentrated around the average or spread out?
5.  What is (are) the most common value(s)?


### These are all important *statistics* of a numeric variable.

### Let's make these ideas more precise

# Sample statistics for numeric variables

.pull-left[
### Range: 

- max value minus min

### Nth percentile (aka quantile): 

- value defining a cutoff so that N percent (appropximately) of your data is below that value 

### Median: 

- 50th percentile, half of the data is below this value, half above
]
.pull-right[


### Mean: 

- average

### Variance: 

- average squared distance of values from the mean. A way to think about how *spread out* the data are
]

class: left, top

### Example: Guessing the Nth percentile
Use bar height to guess bin such that N percent of data is below it. Hard to tell with some plots! Remember $1e6 = 10^6 = 1$ million.

## Math definitions
If I have some number $n$ data points, I will represent my numeric variable values by $$X_1, X_2 ... X_n  $$

.pull-left[
### mean

$$\bar{X} = \frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^n X_i = X_1 + X_2 + \ldots X_n $$
]
.pull-right[
### variance
$$\frac{1}{n}\sum_{i = 1}^n \left(X_i - \bar{X}\right)^2$$
]

### Warning!
For reasons not important to this class, sometimes statistical software will calculate variance with $\frac{1}{n-1}$ in front instead of $\frac{1}{n}$. 

We'll talk about it in the data homework.

## Averages are everywhere. What do they tell us, and not?

.pull-left[
### does not tell you

- how evenly values are spread
- min/max
- whether a few extremely big (positive or negative) values are influencing the calculation
- **median** tells you about the middle but **is less sensitive to extreme values**
]
.pull-right[
### but important because

- a common way to capture the 'middle' value, along with median
- magic of the bell curve: we'll see this later!

## These two variables have approximately the same average, $\bar{X} = 0$

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
d <- data.frame(b = ifelse(runif(5000) < .5, -1, 1), x = rnorm(5000))
```


.pull-left[
```{r}
ggplot(d, aes(x = b)) + geom_histogram(fill = '#dc322f') + theme_minimal()
```

.pull-right[
```{r}
ggplot(d, aes(x = x)) + geom_histogram(fill = '#dc322f') + theme_minimal()
