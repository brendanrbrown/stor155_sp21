NARRATOR,"Once upon a time, in a faraway land, a young prince lived in a;shining castle.  Although he had everything his heart desired,;the prince was spoiled, selfish, and unkind.  But then, one;winter's night, an old beggar woman came to the castle and;offered him a single rose in return for shelter from the bitter;cold. Repulsed by her haggard appearance, the prince sneered at;the gift and turned the old woman away, but she warned him not;to be deceived by appearances, for beauty is found within. And when he dismissed her again, the old woman's ugliness;melted away to reveal a beautiful enchantress.  The prince;tried to apologize, but it was too late, for she had seen that;there was no love in his heart, and as punishment, she;transformed him into a hideous beast, and placed a;powerful spell on the castle, and all who lived there. Ashamed of his monstrous form, the beast concealed himself;inside his castle, with a magic mirror as his only window to;the outside world.  The rose she had offered was truly an;enchanted rose, which would bloom until his twenty-first;year.  If he could learn to love another, and earn her love in;return by the time the last petal fell, then the spell would;be broken.  If not, he would be doomed to remain a beast for;all time.  As the years passed, he fell into despair, and lost;all hope, for who could ever learn to love a beast?"
BELLE,"Little town, it's a quiet village;Every day, like the one before;Little town, full of little people;Waking up to say..."
TOWNSFOLK 1,Bonjour!
TOWNSFOLK 2,Bonjour!
TOWNSFOLK 3,Bonjour!
TOWNSFOLK 4,Bonjour!
TOWNSFOLK 5,Bonjour!
BELLE,There goes the baker with his tray like always;The same old bread and rolls to sell;Ev'ry morning just the same;Since the morning that we came;To this poor provincial town...
BAKER,"Good morning, Belle!"
BELLE,Morning monsieur!
BAKER,Where are you off to?
BELLE,"The bookshop! I just finished the most wonderful story, about;a beanstalk and an ogre and..."
BAKER,"That's nice...Marie, the baguettes! Hurry up!!"
TOWNSFOLK,"Look there she goes, that girl is strange no question;Dazed and distracted, can't you tell?"
WOMAN 1,Never part of any crowd

BOOKSELLER,"Ah, Belle!"
BELLE,Good morning.  I've come to return the book I borrowed.
BOOKSELLER,Finished already?
BELLE,"Oh, I couldn't put it down!  Have you got anything new?"
BOOKSELLER,Not since yesterday.
BELLE,That's all right.  I'll borrow... this one.
BOOKSELLER,That one?  But you've read it twice!
BELLE,"Well it's my favorite!   Far off places, daring;swordfights, magic spells,  a prince in disguise!"
BOOKSELLER,"Well, if you like it all that much,;it's yours!"
BELLE,But sir!
BOOKSELLER,I insist!
BELLE,Well thank you.  Thank you very much!
MEN,;Look there she goes;That girl is so peculiar! I wonder if she's feeling well! W
MEN,With a dreamy far-off look!
MEN,And her nose stuck in a book! ALL           What a puzzle to the rest of us is Belle!
BELLE,"Oh! Isn't this amazing! It's my favorite part because, you'll see! Here's where she meets Prince Charming;But she won't discover that it's him 'til chapter three!"
WOMAN 5,Now it's no wonder that her name means 'beauty';Her looks have got no parallel!
MERCHANT,But behind that fair facade;I'm afraid she's rather odd;Very different from the rest of us...
ALL,She's nothing like the rest of us;Yes different from the rest of us is Belle;
LEFOU,"Wow! You didn't miss a shot, Gaston!  You're the;greatest hunter in the whole world!"
GASTON,I know!
LEFOU,Huh.  No beast alive stands a chance against;you...and no girl for that matter!
GASTON,"It's true, Lefou, and I've got my sights set on that;one!"
LEFOU,The inventor's daughter?
GASTON,She's the one!  The lucky girl I'm going to marry.
LEFOU,But she's--
GASTON,The most beautiful girl in town.
LEFOU,I know--
GASTON,And that makes her the best.  And don't I deserve the best?
LEFOU,"Well of course, I mean you do, but I mean..."
GASTON,"Right from the moment when I met her, saw her;I said she's gorgeous and I fell;Here in town there's only she ;Who is beautiful as me;So I'm making plans to woo and marry Belle"
BIMBETTES,"Look there he goes, isn't he dreamy;Monsieur Gaston, oh he's so cute;Be still my heart, I'm hardly breathing;He's such a tall, dark, strong and handsome brute;"

GROUP 1,But she really is a funny girl
GROUP 2,A beauty but a funny girl
ALL,She really is a funny girl! That Belle!
GASTON,"Hello, Belle."
BELLE,"Bonjour Gaston.   Gaston,;may I have my book, please?"
GASTON,How can you read this? There's no pictures!
BELLE,"Well, some people use their imaginations."
GASTON,"Belle, it's about time you got your head out of those books;  and paid attention to more;important things...like me! The whole town's talking about;it.     It's not;right for a woman to read--soon she starts getting ideas... and thinking."
BELLE,"Gaston, you are positively primeval."
GASTON,"Why thank you,;Belle.  Hey, whaddya say you and me take a walk over to;the tavern and have a look at my hunting trophies."
BELLE,Maybe some other time.
BIMBETTE 1,What's wrong with her?
BIMBETTE 2,She's crazy!
BIMBETTE 3,He's gorgeous!
BELLE,"Please, Gaston. I can't.  I have to get home and help my;father."
LEFOU,"Ha ha ha, that crazy old loon, he need all the help he can get!"
BELLE,Don't you talk about my father that way!
GASTON,"Yeah, don't talk about her father that way!"
BELLE,My father's not crazy!  He's a genius!
BELLE,Papa?
MAURICE,How on earth did that happen? Dog gonnit!
BELLE,"Are you all right, Papa?"
MAURICE,I'm about ready to give up on this hunk of junk!
BELLE,You always say that.
MAURICE,"I mean it, this time.  I'll never get this boneheaded contraption;to work."
BELLE,"Yes, you will.  And you'll win first prize at the fair tomorrow"
MAURICE,Hmmmph!
BELLE,...and become a world famous inventor!
MAURICE,You really believe that?
BELLE,I always have.
MAURICE,"Well, what are we waiting for.  I'll have this thing fixed in no;time.   Hand me that dog-legged clencher;there...  So, did you have a good time in town today?"
BELLE,"I got a new book.  Papa, do you think I'm odd?"
MAURICE,My daughter?  Odd?   Where would;you get an idea like that?
BELLE,"Oh, I don't know.  It's just I'm not sure I fit in here. There's no one I can really talk to."
MAURICE,What about that Gaston?  He's a handsome fellow!
BELLE,"He's handsome all right, and rude and conceited and...Oh Papa,;he's not for me!"
MAURICE,"Well, don't you worry, cause this invention's going to be the;start of a new life for us.   I;think that's done it.  Now, let's give it a try."
BELLE,It works!
MAURICE,It does? It does!
BELLE,You did it!  You really did it!
MAURICE,"Hitch up Phillipe, girl.  I'm off to the fair! ;"
BELLE,"Good bye, Papa! Good luck!"
MAURICE,"Good bye, Belle, and take care while I'm gone!"
MAURICE,We should be there by now.  Maybe we missed a turn. I guess I;should have taken a...wait a minute.  ;Let's go this way!
MAURICE,"Come on, Phillipe!  It's a shortcut.  We'll be there in no time!"
MAURICE,"This can't be right.  Where have you taken us, Phillipe?  We'd;better turn around...and...whoa...whoa boy, whoa Phillipe. Oh,;oh! Look out!"
MAURICE,"Back up! Back up! Back up! Good boy, good boy. That's good,;that's--back up!  Steady. Steady!  Hey now. Steady.  Phillipe!   Phillipe?  Oh no!"
MAURICE,Help!  Is someone there?
MAURICE,Hello? Hello?
LUMIERE,Old fellow must have lost his way in the;woods.
COGSWORTH,Keep quiet!  Maybe he'll go away.
MAURICE,Is someone there?
COGSWORTH,"Not a word, Lumiere. Not one word!"
MAURICE,"I don't mean to intrude, but I've lost my horse and I need a;place;to stay for the night."
LUMIERE,";Oh Cogsworth, have a heart."
COGSWORTH,Shush shush shhhhh!  ;Ow ow Ow OW OW OUCH!!!!!
LUMIERE,"Of course, monsieur, you are welcome here."
MAURICE,Who said that?
LUMIERE,Over here!
MAURICE,Where?
LUMIERE,;Allo!

COGSWORTH,"Well, now you've done it, Lumiere. Splendid,;just peachy--aaarrrgghh!"
MAURICE,How is this accomplished?
COGSWORTH,"Put me down! At once!   Sir, close that at once, do you mind!"
MAURICE,"I beg your pardon, it's just that I've never seen a clock;that...aah...i mean...aah aah aah-chooo!!!!"
LUMIERE,"Oh, you are soaked to the bone, monsieur.  Come, warm yourself by;the fire."
MAURICE,Thank you.
COGSWORTH,"No, no, no, do you know what the master would do if he finds you;here.   I demand that you;stop...right...there!   Oh;no, not the master's chair!  I'm not seeing this, I'm not seeing this!"
MAURICE,"Well, hello there, boy.  What service!"
COGSWORTH,"All right, this has gone far enough.  I'm in charge here, and;"
MRS. POTTS,"How would you like a nice;spot of tea, sir?  It'll warm you up in no time."
COGSWORTH,"No! No tea, no tea!!!"
CHIP,"Ha ha!  His moustache tickles, momma!"
MAURICE,Oh!  Hello!
CHIP,Uh oh!
BEAST,There's a stranger here.
LUMIERE,"Master, allow me to explain.  The;gentleman was lost in the woods and he was cold and wet..."
COGSWORTH,"Master, I'd like to take this;moment to say...I was against this from the start.  I tried to;stop them, but would they listen to me?  No, no, no! ;"
BEAST,Who are you!  What are you doing here?
MAURICE,I was;lost;in the woods and...
BEAST,You are not welcome here!
MAURICE,I'm sorry
BEAST,What are you staring at?
MAURICE,Noth-noth-nothing!
BEAST,";So, you've come to stare at the beast, have you?"
MAURICE,"Please, I meant no harm! I just needed a place to stay ."
BEAST,I'll give you a place to stay!  ;
LEFOU,"Heh! Oh boy! Belle's gonna get the surprise of her life,  huh;Gaston."
GASTON,Yep.  This is her lucky day!
GASTON,"I'd like to thank you all for coming to my wedding.  But first, I;better go in there and... propose to the girl!   Now, you Lefou.  When Belle and;I come out that door--"
LEFOU,"Oh I know, I know! ""Here Comes the Bride."" GASTON slams a baritone over his head.)"
GASTON,Not yet!
LEFOU,"Sorry! -eye view of GASTON.  She moans, and pushes the;door open.)"
BELLE,"Gaston, what a pleasant...surprise."
GASTON,"Isn't it though? I'm just full of surprises.  You know, Belle. There's not a girl in town who wouldn't love to be in your shoes. This is the day... This is the day your dreams come true."
BELLE,"What do you know about my dreams, Gaston?"
GASTON,"Plenty.  Here, picture this.  -covered feet up on BELLE's book. He begins to kick;off his boots and wiggle his toes through his hole-y socks.)  A;rustic hunting lodge, my latest kill roasting on the fire, and my;little wife, massaging my feet, while the little ones play with;the dogs.    We'll have six or seven."
BELLE,Dogs?
GASTON,"No, Belle!  Strapping boys, like me!"
BELLE,Imagine that.
GASTON,And do you know who that wife will be?
BELLE,Let me think.
GASTON,"You, Belle!"
BELLE,"Gaston, I'm speechless.  I really;don't know what to say."
GASTON,Say you'll marry me.
BELLE,"I'm very sorry, Gaston, but I just;don't deserve you. ;""Here Comes the Bride.""  GASTON's boots are;thrown out of the door  and the door is slammed shut. LEFOU,;who is directing the band, looks down and sees GASTON's legs sticking out of;the;mud, and a PIERRE's head sticking up.  LEFOU cuts off the band, and GASTON's;head pops up, with the pig on top of him.  He tilts his head, and the pig;slides;down his back.)"
LEFOU,"So, how'd it go?"
GASTON,"I'll have Belle for my wife, make no;mistake about that!"
LEFOU,Touchy!
PIERRE,Grunt Grunt.
BELLE,"Is he gone? Can you imagine, he asked me to;marry him.  Me, the wife of that;boorish, brainless... Madame Gaston, can't you just see it;Madame Gaston, his little wife;Not me, no sir, I guarantee it;I want much more than this provincial life... I want adventure in the great wide somewhere;I want it more than I can tell;And for once it might be grand;To have someone understand;I want so much more than they've got planned;"
BELLE,"Phillipe!  What are you doing here?   Where's Papa? Where is he,;Phillipe?  What happened? Oh, we have to find him, you have to;take me to him!"
BELLE,What is this place?
BELLE,"Phillipe, please, steady.   Papa."
COGSWORTH,"Couldn't keep quiet, could we.  Just had to invite him to stay,;didn't we?  Serve him tea, sit in the master's chair, pet the;pooch."
LUMIERE,I was trying to be hospitable.
BELLE,"Hello?  Is anyone here?  Hello? Papa?  Papa, are you here?"
CHIP,Momma.  There's a girl in the castle!
MRS. POTTS,"Now, Chip, I won't have you making up such wild stories."
CHIP,"But really, momma, I saw her."
MRS. POTTS,Not another word.  Into the tub.
FEATHERDUSTER,;A girl!  I saw a girl in the castle!
CHIP,"See, I told ya!"
COGSWORTH,"Irresponsible, devil-may-care, waxy eared, slack-jawed--"
BELLE,Papa?
LUMIERE,Did you see that?   It's a girl!
COGSWORTH,I know it's a girl.
LUMIERE,Don't you see?  She's the one. The girl we have been waiting for. She has come to break the spell!
COGSWORTH,"Wait a minute, wait a minute!"
BELLE,"Papa?  Papa?  Hello? Is someone here?  Wait!  I'm looking for my father!   That's funny, I'm sure there was someone... I-I-Is there anyone here?"
MAURICE,Belle?
BELLE,"Oh, Papa!"
MAURICE,How did you find me?
BELLE,"Oh, your hands are like ice.  We have to get you out of here."
MAURICE,"Belle, I want you to leave this place."
BELLE,Who's done this to you?
MAURICE,No time to explain. You must go...now!
BELLE,I won't leave you!
BEAST,What are you doing here?
MAURICE,"Run, Belle!"
BELLE,Who's there? Who are you?
BEAST,The master of this castle.
BELLE,I've come for my father.  Please let him out!  Can't you see he's;sick?
BEAST,Then he shouldn't have trespassed here.
BELLE,"But he could die.  Please, I'll do anything!"
BEAST,There's nothing you can do.  He's my prisoner.
BELLE,"Oh, there must be some way I can...wait!  Take me, instead!"
BEAST,You! You would take his place?
MAURICE,Belle!  No!  You don't know what you're doing!
BELLE,"If I did, would you let him go?"
BEAST,"Yes, but you must promise to stay here forever."
BELLE,Come  into the light.
MAURICE,"No, Belle.  I won't let you do this! -ish look)"
BELLE,You have my word.
BEAST,Done!
MAURICE,"No, Belle.  Listen to me.  I'm old, I've lived my life--;"
BELLE,Wait!
MAURICE,Belle!
BELLE,Wait!
MAURICE,"No, please spare my daughter!"
BEAST,She's no longer your concern.   Take him to the village.
MAURICE,"Please, let me out, please!"
LUMIERE,Master?
BEAST,What!
LUMIERE,"Since the girl is going to be with us for quite some time, I was;thinking that you might want to offer her a more comfortable;room.  Then again, maybe not."
BELLE,You didn't even let me say good bye. I'll never see him again. I;didn't get to say good-bye.
BEAST,I'll show you to your room.
BELLE,My room?  But I thought--
BEAST,"You wanna, you wanna stay in the tower?"
BELLE,No.
BEAST,Then follow me.
LUMIERE,Say something to her.
BEAST,"Hmm?  Oh.    I...um...hope you like it here.    The;castle is your home now, so you can go anywhere you wish, except;the West Wing."
BELLE,What's in the West Wing?
BEAST,It's forbidden!
BEAST,"Now, if there's anything you need, my servants will;attend you."
LUMIERE,Dinner--invite her to dinner.
BEAST,You...will join me for dinner.  That's not a;request!
GASTON,Who does she think she is?  That girl has tangled with the wrong;man.  No one says 'no' to Gaston!
LEFOU,Darn right!
GASTON,"Dismissed.  Rejected.  Publicly humiliated.  Why, it's more than;I;can bear."
LEFOU,More beer?
GASTON,What for?  Nothing helps.  I'm;disgraced.
LEFOU,"Who, you?  Never.  Gaston, you've got to pull yourself together. Gosh it disturbs me to see you, Gaston;Looking so down in the dumps;Every guy here'd love to be you, Gaston ;Even when taking your lumps;There's no man in town as admired as you;You're everyone's favorite guy;Everyone's awed and inspired by you ;And it's not very hard to see why! No one's slick as Gaston, no one's quick as Gaston;No one's next as incredibly thick as Gaston;For there's no man in town half as manly;Perfect, a pure paragon! You can ask any Tom, Dick, or Stanley;And they'll tell you who's team they'd prefer to be on!"
OLD CRONIES,"No one's been like Gaston, a king-pin like Gaston"
LEFOU,No one's got a swell cleft in his chin like Gaston
GASTON,"As a specimen, yes, I'm intimidating!"
OLD CRONIES,"My, what a guy that Gaston!"
OLD CRONIES,"Give five hurrahs, give twelve hip-hips"
LEFOU,Gaston is the best and the rest is all drips!
ALL,"No one fights like Gaston, no one bites like Gaston"
WRESTLER,"In a wrestling match, nobody bites like Gaston"
BIMBETTES,For there's no one as burly and brawny
GASTON,As you see I've got biceps to spare
LEFOU,Not a bit of him scraggly or scrawny
GASTON,That's right! And every last bit of me's covered with hair!
OLD CRONIES,"No one hits like Gaston, matches wits like Gaston"
LEFOU,"In a spitting match, nobody spits like Gaston!"
GASTON,I'm especially good at expectorating! Ptooey!
ALL,Ten points for Gaston!
GASTON,"When I was a lad I ate four dozen eggs;Every morning to help me get large! And now that I'm grown, I eat five dozen eggs;So I'm roughly the size of a barge!"
ALL,"No one shoots like Gaston, makes those beauts like Gaston"
LEFOU,Then goes tromping around wearing boots like Gaston
GASTON,"I use antlers in all of my decorating! ""Gaston Reprise"");"
ALL,My what a guy! Gaston!!!!!!!
MAURICE,Help! Someone help me! OLD
MAN,Maurice?
MAURICE,"Please!  Please, I need your help! He's got her.  He's got her;locked in the dungeon."
LEFOU,Who?
MAURICE,Belle. We must go.  Not a minute to lose!
GASTON,"Whoa!  Slow down, Maurice.  Who's got Belle locked in a dungeon?"
MAURICE,"A beast! A horrible, monstrous beast!"
CRONY 1,Is it a big beast?
MAURICE,Huge!
CRONY 2,"With a long, ugly snout?"
MAURICE,Hideously ugly!
CRONY 3,"And sharp, cruel fangs?"
MAURICE,"Yes, yes.  Will you help me?"
GASTON,"All right, old man.  We'll help you out."
MAURICE,"You will? Oh thank you, thank you!"
CRONY 1,Crazy old Maurice.  He's always good for a laugh!
GASTON,"Crazy old Maurice, hmm?  Crazy old Maurice. Hmmm? Lefou, I'm afraid I've been thinking."
LEFOU,A dangerous pastime--
GASTON,"I know,;But that wacky old coot is Belle's father;And his sanity's only so-so;Now the wheels in my head have been turning;Since I looked at that loony old man;See I promised myself I'd be married to Belle,;And right now I'm evolving a plan!"
GASTON,If I...
LEFOU,Yes?
GASTON,Then I...
LEFOU,"No, would she?"
GASTON,...GUESS!
LEFOU,Now I get it!
BOTH,Let's go!
BOTH,"No one plots like Gaston, takes cheap shots like Gaston"
LEFOU,Plans to persecute harmless crackpots like Gaston
ALL,"So his marriage we soon'll be celebrating! My what a guy, Gaston!!!"
MAURICE,Will no one help me?
BELLE,Who is it?
MRS. POTTS,"Mrs. Potts, dear.   I;thought you might like a spot of tea."
BELLE,;But you...ah...but...I--;
WARDROBE,Oof.  Careful!
BELLE,This is impossible--
WARDROBE,"I know it is, but here we are!"
CHIP,"Told ya she was;pretty, mama,  didn't I?"
MRS. POTTS,"All right, now, Chip.  That'll do.  Slowly, now.  Don't spill!"
BELLE,Thank you.
CHIP,Wanna see me do a trick?
MRS. POTTS,Chip!
CHIP,Oops.  Sorry.
MRS. POTTS,"That was a very brave thing you did, my dear."
WARDROBE,We all think so.
BELLE,"But I've lost my father, my dreams, everything."
MRS. POTTS,"Cheer up, child.  It'll turn out all right in the end.  You'll;see.    Oops!  Look at me, jabbering on,;when there's a supper to get on the table.  Chip!"
CHIP,Bye!
WARDROBE,"Well now, what shall we dress you in for dinner?  Let's see what;I've got in my drawers.    Oh!  How embarrassing. Here we are.  Ah! There, you'll look ravishing in this one!"
BELLE,"That's very kind of you, but I'm not going to dinner."
WARDROBE,"Oh, but you must!"
COGSWORTH,"Ahem, ahem, ahem.  Dinner...is served."
BEAST,What's taking so long? I told her to come down.  Why isn't she;here yet?!?
MRS. POTTS,"Oh, try to be patient, sir.  The girl has lost her father and;her freedom all in one day."
LUMIERE,"Uh, master.  Have you thought that, perhaps, this girl could be;the one to break the spell?"
BEAST,Of course I have.  I'm not a fool.
LUMIERE,"Good.  You fall in love with her, she falls in love with you,;and--Poof!--the spell is broken! We'll be human again by;midnight! -- ""Human;Again"")"
MRS. POTTS,"Oh, it's not that easy, Lumiere.  These things take time."
LUMIERE,But the rose has already begun to wilt.
BEAST,"It's no use.  She's so beautiful, and I'm so...well, look at me!"
MRS. POTTS,"Oh, you must help her to see past all that."
BEAST,I don't know how.
MRS. POTTS,"Well, you can start by making yourself more presentable. Straighten up, try to act like a gentleman."
LUMIERE,"Ah yes, when she comes in, give her a dashing,;debonair smile.  Come, come.  Show me the smile."
MRS. POTTS,But don't frighten the poor girl.
LUMIERE,Impress her with your rapier wit.
MRS. POTTS,But be gentle.
LUMIERE,Shower her with compliments.
MRS. POTTS,But be sincere
LUMIERE,And above all...
BOTH,You must control your temper!
LUMIERE,Here she is!
COGSWORTH,"Uh, good evening."
BEAST,"Well, where is she?"
COGSWORTH,"Who?  Oh!  The girl. Yes,  the, ah, girl.  Well,;actually, she's in the process of, ah, um, circumstances being;what they are, ah... she's not coming."
BEAST,WHAT!!!!!!!
COGSWORTH,Your grace! Your eminence!  Let's not be hasty!
BEAST,I thought I told you to come down to dinner!
BELLE,I'm not hungry.
BEAST,You'll come out or I'll...I'll break down the door!
LUMIERE,"Master, I could be wrong, but that may not be the;best way to win the girl's affections."
COGSWORTH,Please! Attempt to be a gentleman.
BEAST,But she is being so...difficult!
MRS. POTTS,"Gently, gently."
BEAST,Will you come down to dinner?
BELLE,No!
COGSWORTH,Suave.  Genteel.
BEAST,It would give me great;pleasure if you would join me for dinner.
COGSWORTH,"Ahem, ahem, we say 'please.'"
BEAST,...please.
BELLE,"No, thank you."
BEAST,You can't stay in there forever!
BELLE,Yes I can!
BEAST,"Fine!  Then go ahead and STARVE!!!!  If she doesn't;eat with me, then she doesn't eat at all!"
MRS. POTTS,"That didn't go very well at all, did it."
COGSWORTH,"Lumiere, stand watch at the door and inform me at once if there;is the slightest change."
LUMIERE,"You can count on me, mon;capitan."
COGSWORTH,"Well, I guess we better go downstairs and start cleaning up."
BEAST,"I ask nicely, but she refuses.  What a...what does she want me to;do--beg?   Show me the girl."
WARDROBE,Why the master's not so bad once you get to;know him.  Why don't you give him a chance?
BELLE,I don't want to get to know him. I don't want to have anything to do with him!
BEAST,I'm just fooling;myself. She'll never see me as anything...but a monster.   It's hopeless. /Fade in to;ext of BELLE's room. Door creaks open.  BELLE silently emerges.  We see her;feet;go by as three bright spots shine through a curtain at floor level.  Behind it;are LUMIERE and FEATHERDUSTER.)
FEATHERDUSTER,";Oh, no!"
LUMIERE,"Oh, yes!"
FEATHERDUSTER,";Oh, no!"
LUMIERE,"Oh, yes, yes, yes!"
FEATHERDUSTER,;I've been burnt by you before!
FEATHERDUSTER,;Oof!
LUMIERE,Zut alors! She has emerged!
MRS. POTTS,"Come on, Chip.  Into the cupboard with your brothers and;sisters."
CHIP,But I'm not sleepy.
MRS. POTTS,Yes you are.
CHIP,"No, I'm...not. ;"
STOVE,"I work and I slave all day, and for what?  A culinary masterpiece;gone to waste."
MRS. POTTS,"Oh, stop your grousing.  It's been a long night for all of us."
COGSWORTH,"Well, if you ask me, she was just being stubborn.  After all,;the master did say 'please.'"
MRS. POTTS,"But if the master doesn't learn to control that temper, he'll;never break the--;"
COGSWORTH,"Splendid to see you out and about, mademoiselle.  I am Cogsworth, head of the;household.   This is Lumiere."
LUMIERE,"En chante, cherie."
COGSWORTH,If there's anything...stop that...that we can...please;...to make your stay more;comfortable.   Ow!!!!
BELLE,I am a little hungry.
MRS. POTTS,"You are? Hear that? She's;hungry.  Stoke the fire, break out the silver, wake the china."
COGSWORTH,Remember what the master said.
MRS. POTTS,"Oh, pish tosh.  I'm not going to let the poor child go hungry."
COGSWORTH,"Oh, all;right.  Glass of water, crust of bread, and then--"
LUMIERE,"Cogsworth, I am surprised at you.  She's not our prisoner.  She's;our guest.  We must make her feel welcome here.  ;Right this way, mademoiselle."
COGSWORTH,"Well keep it down. If the master finds out about this, it will;be our necks!"
LUMIERE,"Of course, of course.  But what is dinner without a little music?"
COGSWORTH,MUSIC!?!
LUMIERE,"Ma chere, mademoiselle.  It is with deepest pleasure and;greatest pride that I welcome you tonight.  And now, we invite;you to relax. Let us pull up a chair as the dining room proudly;presents...your dinner. Be our guest, be our guest;Put our service to the test,;tie your napkin 'round your neck, cherie;and we provide the rest! -esque' swimming scene.);We tell jokes, I do tricks;With my fellow candlesticks;"
MUGS,And it's all in perfect taste;That you can bet!!!
ALL,"Come on and lift your glass,;You've won your own free pass;To be our guest, be our guest, be our guest!"
LUMIERE,"If you're stressed, it's fine dining we suggest!"
ALL,"Be our guest, be our guest, be our guest!"
LUMIERE,"Life is so unnerving,;For a servant who's not serving! He's not whole without a soul to wait upon"
COGSWORTH,Get off!
LUMIERE,"Ah, those good old days when we were useful;Suddenly, those good old days are gone."
LUMIERE,"Ten years we've been rusting;Needing so much more than dusting;Needing exercise, a chance to use our skills! Most days just lay around the castle,;Flabby fat and lazy;You walked in, and oops-a-daisie!"
MRS. POTTS,"It's a guest, it's a guest! Sakes alive, well I'll be blessed! Wine's been poured and thank the Lord;I've had the napkins freshly pressed! With dessert, she'll want tea,;And my dear, that's fine with me! While the cups do their soft shoeing,;I'll be bubbling, I'll be brewing! I'll get warm, piping hot;Heaven's sake, is that a spot? Clean it up, we want the company impressed! We've got a lot to do--;Is it one lump or two? For you our guest!"
ALL,She's our guest!
MRS. POTTS,She's our guest!
ALL,"She's our guest! Be our guest! Be our guest! Our command is your request! It's ten years since we had anybody here;And we're obsessed! With your meal, with your ease,;Yes indeed, we aim to please;While the candlelight's still glowing;Let us help you, we'll keep going--;"
ALL,";Course, by course;One by one;'Til you shout ""Enough, I'm done!"";Then we'll sing you off to sleep as you digest;Tonight you'll prop your feet up,;But for let's eat up;Be our guest!  Be our guest!  Be our guest! Please Be our guest!!"
BELLE,Bravo!  That was wonderful!
COGSWORTH,"Thank you, thank you, mademoiselle. Yes, good show, wasn't it;everyone.   Oh, my goodness, will you;look at the time.  Now, it's off to bed, off to bed!"
BELLE,"Oh, I couldn't possibly go to bed now.  It's my first time in;an enchanted castle."
COGSWORTH,"Enchanted?  Who said anything about the castle being enchanted? It was you, wasn't it!"
BELLE,"I, um, figured it out for myself.  I'd like to look;around, if that's all right."
LUMIERE,Oh!  Would you like a tour?
COGSWORTH,"Wait a second, wait a second.  I'm not sure that's such a good;idea.  We can't let her go poking;around in certain places, if you know what I mean."
BELLE,;Perhaps you could take me.  I'm sure you know everything there;is to know about the castle.
COGSWORTH,"Well, actually, ah yes, I do!"
COGSWORTH,"As you can see, the pseudo facade was stripped away to reveal a;minimalist rococo design.  Note the unusual inverted vaulted;ceilings.  This is yet another example of the neo-classic baroque;period, and as I always say, if it's not baroque, don't fix it! Ha ha ha. Now then, where was I?  As you were!   Now, if I may draw your;attention to the flying buttresses above the--mademoiselle?"
BELLE,What's up there?
COGSWORTH,"Where? Up there?  Nothing. Absolutely nothing of interest at all;in the West Wing.  Dusty, dull, very boring."
BELLE,"Oh, so that's the West Wing."
LUMIERE,Nice going!
BELLE,I wonder what he's hiding up there.
LUMIERE,Hiding? The master is hiding nothing!
BELLE,Then it wouldn't be forbidden.
COGSWORTH,Perhaps mademoiselle would like to see something else.  We have;exquisite tapestries dating all the way back to...
BELLE,Maybe later.
LUMIERE,"The gardens, or the;library perhaps?"
BELLE,You have a library?
COGSWORTH,Oh yes! Indeed!
LUMIERE,With books!
COGSWORTH,Gads of books!
LUMIERE,Mountains of books!
COGSWORTH,Forests of books!
LUMIERE,Cascades...
COGSWORTH,...of books!
LUMIERE,Swamps of books!
COGSWORTH,"More books than you'll ever be able to read in a lifetime! Books on every subject ever studied, by every author who ever;set pen to paper..."
BEAST,Why did you come here?
BELLE,"I'm sorry,"
BEAST,I warned you never to come here!
BELLE,I didn't mean any harm.
BEAST,Do you realize what you could have done?
BELLE,"Please, stop! No!"
BEAST,Get out!!!! GET OUT!!!!
LUMIERE,Wh- Where are you going?
BELLE,"Promise or no promise, I can't stay here another minute!"
COGSWORTH,"Oh no, wait, please wait! -air by BEAST.    He throws the WOLF away, then stands behind them;and BELLE.  They lunge at each other.  One rips a hole in BEAST's shoulder, and;the others focus their attack on that spot.  Finally, BEAST throws a WOLF;against a tree, knocking it out.  The others turn and run in fear.  BEAST turns;back to BELLE, looks at her despairingly, then collapses.  BELLE, grateful to;be;alive, turns back to PHILLIPE and begins to get on, but her conscience takes;over, and she walks over to the fallen BEAST.  Fade to BELLE and PHILLIPE;walking back to the castle, with BEAST on the horse's back.  Fade to int of;den,;with BELLE pouring hot water out of MRS. POTTS.  She soaks a rag in the water,;then turns to BEAST, who is licking his wounds.)"
BELLE,"Here now. Oh, don't do that.  Just...hold still."
BEAST,That hurts!
BELLE,"If you'd hold still, it wouldn't hurt as much."
BEAST,"Well if you hadn't run away, this wouldn't have happened!"
BELLE,"Well if you hadn't frightened me, I wouldn't have run away!"
BEAST,Well you shouldn't have been in the West Wing!
BELLE,"Well you should learn to control your temper!     Now, hold still. This may;sting a little.    By the way,;thank you, for saving my life."
BEAST,You're welcome. D
ARQUE,"I don't usually leave the asylum in the middle of the night, but;they said you'd make it worth my while.    Aah, I'm listening."
GASTON,"It's like this.  I've got my heart set on marrying Belle, but she;needs a little persuasion."
LEFOU,Turned him down flat!
GASTON,Everyone knows her father's a lunatic.  He was in here tonight;raving about a beast in a castle... D
ARQUE,Maurice is harmless.
GASTON,"The point is, Belle would do anything to keep him from being;locked up."
LEFOU,"Yeah, even marry him! D"
ARQUE,"So you want me to throw her father in the asylum unless she;agrees;to marry you?   Oh, that is;despicable.  I love it!"
MAURICE,"If no one will help me, then I'll go back alone.  I don't care;what it takes.  I'll find that castle and somehow I'll get her;out of there."
GASTON,Belle! Maurice!
LEFOU,"Oh, well, I guess it's not gonna work after all."
GASTON,"They have to come back sometime, and when they do, we'll be ready;for them.  Lefou,;don't move from that spot until Belle and her father come home."
LEFOU,"But, but... aww, nuts! ;"
BEAST,I've never felt this way about anyone.   I want;to do something for her.  But what?
COGSWORTH,"Well, there's the usual things--flowers, chocolates, promises;you don't intend to keep..."
LUMIERE,"Ahh, no no.  It has to be something very special.  Something that;sparks her inter--wait a minute."
BEAST,"Belle, there's something I want to show you.   But first, you have to close your eyes.  It's a surprise."
BELLE,Can I open them?
BEAST,"No, no.  Not yet.  Wait here."
BELLE,Now can I open them?
BEAST,All right.  Now.
BELLE,I can't believe it. I've never seen so many books in all my life!
BEAST,You--you like it?
BELLE,It's wonderful.
BEAST,Then it's yours.
BEAST,"Oh, thank you so much."
MRS. POTTS,"Oh, would you look at that?"
LUMIERE,Ha ha! I knew it would work.
CHIP,What?  What works?
COGSWORTH,It's very encouraging.
FEATHERDUSTER,;Isn't this exciting!
CHIP,I didn't see anything.
MRS. POTTS,"Come along, Chip.  There's chores to be done in the kitchen."
CHIP,"But what are they talking about? What's going on? -D-ishly).  BELLE;looks;at him in wonder as he tries to eat with the spoon, but he has little success. Finally, BELLE puts down her spoon and lifts her bowl as if in a toast.  BEAST;looks at the compromise and does the same.  They both begin to sip their;breakfast out of their bowls.  Fade to courtyard where BELLE and BEAST are;feeding the birds.)"
BELLE,"There's something sweet;And almost kind;But he was mean;And he was coarse and unrefined. But now he's dear;And so unsure,;I wonder why I didn't see it there before."
BEAST,She glanced this way;I thought I saw;And when we touched;She didn't shudder at my paw;No it can't be;I'll just ignore;But then she's never looked at me that way before.
BELLE,"New, and a bit alarming;Who'd have ever thought that this could be? True, that he's no Prince Charming;But there's something in him that I simply didn't see."
LUMIERE,Well who'd have thought?
MRS. POTTS,Well bless my soul.
COGSWORTH,And who'd have known?
MRS. POTTS,Well who indeed?
LUMIERE,And who'd have guessed they'd come together on their own?
MRS. POTTS,It's so peculiar
ALL,We'll wait and see;A few days more;There may be something there that wasn't there before;
COGSWORTH,"Yes, perhaps there's something there that wasn't there before."
CHIP,What?
MRS. POTTS,There may be something there that wasn't there before.
CHIP,"What's there, mama?"
MRS. POTTS,I'll tell you when you're older.
LUMIERE,Tonight is the night!
BEAST,I'm not sure I can do this.
LUMIERE,"You don't have time to be timid.  You must be bold, daring."
BEAST,Bold. Daring.
LUMIERE,"There will be music.  Romantic candlelight, provided myself, and;when the time is right, you confess your love."
BEAST,"Yes, I -- I con--No, I can't."
LUMIERE,"You care for the girl, don't you?"
BEAST,More than anything.
LUMIERE,Well then you must tell her.   Voila.  You look so...so... -tails and bows.)
BEAST,Stupid.
LUMIERE,Not quite the word I was looking for.  Perhaps a little more off;the top.
COGSWORTH,Ahem ahem ahem.  Your lady awaits.
MRS. POTTS,"Tale as old as time;True as it can be;Barely even friends;Then somebody bends unexpectedly. Just a little change;Small to say the least;Both a little scared;Neither one prepared, beauty and the beast."
MRS. POTTS,"Ever just the same;Ever a surprise;Ever as before, ever just as sure;As the sun will rise;Tale as old as time;Tune as old as song;Bittersweet and strange,;Finding you can change, learning you were wrong;Certain as the sun;Rising in the east;Tale as old as time,;Song as old as rhyme, beauty and the beast. Tale as old as time,;Song as old as rhyme, beauty and the beast.  Off to the cupboard with you now, Chip.  It's past;your bedtime.  Good night, love."
BEAST,Belle? Are you happy here with me?
BELLE,Yes.
BEAST,What is it?
BELLE,"If only I could see my father again,;just for a moment.  I miss him so much."
BEAST,There is a way.
BEAST,"This mirror will show you anything, anything you wish to see."
BELLE,"I'd like to see my father, please."
BELLE,"Papa.  Oh, no.  He's sick, he may be dying. And he's all alone."
BEAST,Then...then you must go to him.
BELLE,What did you say?
BEAST,I release you.  You are no longer my prisoner.
BELLE,You mean...I'm free?
BEAST,Yes.
BELLE,"Oh, thank you.   Hold on, Papa.  I'm on my way."
BEAST,"Take it with you, so you'll always have a way to look back, and;remember me."
BELLE,Thank you for understanding how much he needs me.
COGSWORTH,"Well, your highness.  I must say everything is going just;peachy. I knew you had it in you."
BEAST,I let her go.
COGSWORTH,"Ha ha ha, yes.  Splend--   You what? How could you do that?"
BEAST,I had to.
COGSWORTH,"Yes, but why?"
BEAST,"Because, I love her."
ALL,;He did what?!?!
COGSWORTH,"Yes, I'm afraid it's true."
CHIP,She's going away?
LUMIERE,But he was so close.
MRS. POTTS,"After all this time, he's finally learned to love."
LUMIERE,"That's it, then.  That should break the spell."
MRS. POTTS,But it's not enough. She has to love him in return.
COGSWORTH,"And now it's too late. ""Papa?""  Finally, she finds him face down in a snowbank.  They return home,;where LEFOU is still waiting, disguised as a snowman.)"
LEFOU,"Oh, they're back."
MAURICE,Belle?
BELLE,"It's all right, Papa. I'm home."
MAURICE,I thought I'd never see you again.
BELLE,I missed you so much.
MAURICE,But the beast.  How did you escape?
BELLE,"I didn't escape, Papa.  He let me go."
MAURICE,That horrible beast?
BELLE,"But he's different, now.  He's changed somehow."
CHIP,Hi!
BELLE,"Oh, a stowaway."
MAURICE,"Why, hello there, little fella.  Didn't think I'd ever see you;again."
CHIP,"Belle, why'd you go away? Don't you like us anymore?"
BELLE,"Oh, Chip.  Of course I do.  It's just that--;"
BELLE,May I help you? D
ARQUE,I've come to collect your father.
BELLE,My father? D
ARQUE,"Don't worry, mademoiselle.  We'll take good care of him."
BELLE,My father's not crazy.
LEFOU,"He was raving like a lunatic. We all;heard him, didn't we!"
BYSTANDERS,Yeah!
BELLE,"No, I won't let you."
MAURICE,Belle?
LEFOU,"Ah, Maurice.  Tell us again, old man, just how big was the beast?"
MAURICE,"Well, he was...that is...enormous. I'd say at least;eight, no more like ten feet."
LEFOU,"Well, you don't get much crazier than that."
MAURICE,"It's true, I tell you!"
LEFOU,Take him away!
MAURICE,Let go of me!
BELLE,"No, you can't do this!"
GASTON,"Tsk, tsk, tsk. Poor Belle.  It's a shame about your father."
BELLE,"You know he's not crazy, Gaston."
GASTON,"I might be able to clear up this little misunderstanding, if..."
BELLE,If what?
GASTON,If you marry me.
BELLE,What?
GASTON,"One little word, Belle.  That's all it takes."
BELLE,Never!
GASTON,Have it your way.
MAURICE,Belle?  Let go of me!
BELLE,My;father's not crazy and I can prove it!   Show me the;beast!
WOMAN 1,Is it dangerous?
BELLE,"Oh, no.  He'd never hurt anyone. Please,;I know he looks vicious, but he's really kind and gentle.  He's;my;friend."
GASTON,"If I didn't know better, I'd think you had feelings for this;monster."
BELLE,"He's no monster, Gaston. You are!"
GASTON,She's as crazy as the old man.  ;The beast will make off with your children! He'll come after them in the night.
BELLE,No!
GASTON,We're not safe 'til his head is mounted on my wall! I say we kill the beast!
MAN 1,"We're not safe until he's dead,"
MAN 2,He'll come stalking us at night!
WOMAN 1,Set to sacrifice our children to his monstrous appetite!
MAN 3,He'll wreak havoc on our village;If we let him wander free
GASTON,"So it's time to take some action, boys;It's time to follow me! Through the mist, through the woods;Through the darkness and the shadows;It's a nightmare but it's one exciting ride. Say a prayer, then we're there;At the drawbridge of a castle,;And there's something truly terrible inside. It's a beast,;He's got fangs, razor sharp ones;Massive paws,;Killer claws for the feast;Hear him roar, see him foam,;But we're not coming home,;'Til he's dead, good and dead, kill the beast!"
BELLE,"No, I won't let you do this."
GASTON,"If you're not with us, you're against us.  Bring the old man."
MAURICE,Get your hands off me!
GASTON,We can't have them running off to warn the creature!
BELLE,Let us out!
GASTON,"We'll rid the village of this beast. Who's with;me? ""I am""s comes from the CROWD)"
MOB,"Light your torch, mount your horse!"
GASTON,Screw your courage to the sticking place
MOB,"We're counting on Gaston to lead the way! Through a mist, to a wood,;Where within a haunted castle,;Something's lurking that you don't see every day! It's a beast,;One as tall as a mountain! We won't rest;'Til he's good and deceased! Sally forth, tally ho,;Grab your sword, grab your bow;Praise the Lord and here we go!"
GASTON,We'll lay siege to his castle and bring back his head!
BELLE,"I have to warn the beast. This is all my fault.  Oh, Papa.  What;are we going to do?"
MAURICE,"Now, now.  We'll think of something."
MOB,"We don't like, what we don't;Understand, it frankly scares us;And this monster is mysterious at least! Bring your guns, bring your knives,;Save your children and your wives,;We'll save our village and our lives,;We'll kill the beast!"
COGSWORTH,"I knew it, I knew it was foolish to get our hopes up."
LUMIERE,Maybe it would have been better if she had never come at all.
LUMIERE,Could it be?
MRS. POTTS,Is it she?
LUMIERE,"Sacre bleu, invaders!"
COGSWORTH,Encroachers!
MRS. POTTS,And they have the mirror!
COGSWORTH,"Warn the master.  If it's a fight they want,;we'll be ready for them.   Who's with;me?  Aahh!"
GASTON,"Take whatever booty you can find, but remember, the beast is;mine!"
OBJECTS,"Hearts ablaze, banners high! We go marching into battle,;Unafraid, although the danger just increased!"
MOB,"Raise the flag, sing the song;Here we come, we're fifty strong;And fifty Frenchmen can't be wrong,;Let's kill the beast!"
MRS. POTTS,"Pardon me, master."
BEAST,Leave me in peace.
MRS. POTTS,"But sir, the castle is under attack!"
MOB,"Kill the beast, kill the beast!"
LUMIERE,This isn't working!
FEATHERDUSTER,";Oh, Lumiere! We must do something!"
LUMIERE,Wait!  I know!
MOB,"Kill the beast, kill the beast!"
MRS. POTTS,"What shall we do, master?"
BEAST,It doesn't matter now.  Just let them come.
MOB,"Kill the beast, kill the beast, kill the beast!!"
LUMIERE,Now!!!
CHIP,Yes!  Here we go!
MAURICE,"What the devil?  Belle, look out!"
CHIP,You guys gotta try this thing.
COGSWORTH,And stay out!
GASTON,Ha ha ha ha ha!
GASTON,"Get up! Get up!  What's the matter, Beast?  Too kind and gentle;to;fight back?"
BELLE,No!
BEAST,Belle.
BELLE,"Gaston, don't!"
BELLE,"Let's go, Phillipe!"
GASTON,"Come on out and fight!  Were you in love with her, beast?  Did;you;honestly think she'd want you when she had someone like me?"
GASTON,"It's over, beast!  Belle is mine!"
GASTON,"Put me down.  Put me down.  Please, don't hurt me! I'll do;anything! Anything!"
BEAST,Get out!
BELLE,Beast!
BEAST,Belle!
BEAST,Belle? You came back!
BEAST,You came back.
BELLE,Of course I came back.  I couldn't let them...Oh this is all my;fault.  If only I'd gotten here sooner.
BEAST,Maybe it's better this way.
BELLE,Don't talk like that.  You'll be all right.  We're together now. Everything's going to be fine.  You'll see.
BEAST,At least I got to see you one... last...time.
BELLE,"No, no! Please!  Please! Please don't leave me!  I love;you!"
PRINCE,Belle!  It's me!
BELLE,It is you!
PRINCE,"Lumiere!  Cogsworth! Oh, Mrs. Potts! Look at us!"
CHIP,Mama! Mama!
MRS. POTTS,Oh my goodness!
LUMIERE,It is a miracle!
LUMIERE,"Ah, l'amour.    Heh heh!"
COGSWORTH,"Well, Lumiere, old friend.  Shall we let bygones be bygones?"
LUMIERE,"Of course, mon ami.  I told you she would break the spell."
COGSWORTH,"I beg your pardon, old friend, but I believe I told you."
LUMIERE,No you didn't.  I told you.
COGSWORTH,"You most certainly did not, you pompous parrafin-headed;pea-brain!"
LUMIERE,"En garde, you overgrown pocket watch!"
CHIP,"Are they gonna live happily ever after, mama?"
MRS. POTTS,"Of course, my dear. Of course."
CHIP,Do I still have to;sleep in the cupboard?
CHORUS,"Certain as the sun;Rising in the east;Tale as old as time, song as old as rhyme;Beauty and the beast! Tale as old as time, song as old as rhyme;Beauty and the beast!"
